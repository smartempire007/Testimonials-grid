                    who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and i never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular,
                    was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. in fact, I've often referred to it during interviews as an example of my development experience. It certainly helped
                    me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offer. 100% recommend! "
