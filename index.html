                    I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects i learned were current, if not more so, in the company i joined.

                    transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for
                    the free intro course and found it incredible fun! i enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 
                    week was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course, i've
                    successfully switched careers. Working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup."

                "before joining the bootcamp, I've never written a line of code. I needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. i was encouraged to enroll by a former 
                student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and i never had to wait long for assistance. 
                The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. in fact, I've often referred to it during interviews as an 
                example of my development experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offer. 100% recommend! "
